That one your looking at doesnt look good.
That one packs a punch
Watch out of bats
I'm going to join a union
I can juggle 5 of those
Ever been in the castle?
More loot at higher dungeon levels, or so i've heard
Slimes are useless
Look out for chests in the dungeon
That one couldnt hurt a fly
I stole that from camelot
