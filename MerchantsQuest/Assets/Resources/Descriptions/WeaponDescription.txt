Sharper then an icicle
Can smash a brick in two
Couldn't hurt a fly
Can shatter an anvil with just one tap
It's already crumbling
Its basically rust
Breaks on impact
Turns blood into water
Arguably just a stick
Has seen 400 battles
Does your expenses
Made from flowers
Restores 500 health per kill
Throwable up to 200 km
Solid as a rock
Gives the user 5 gold per assist
Can calculate the distance between two points
Made of ice
Made of fire
Made of steel
Made of concrete
